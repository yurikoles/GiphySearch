Please create a simple prototype app that uses the Giphy API to search for gifs and display them in a group. Would be great if you used VIPER or Clean swift
The app does not need to be perfect, but a little bit of polish goes a long way. Weâ€™re mostly interested in seeing clean separation between the business logic, presentation code, and use of Apple best practices.
